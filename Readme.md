# Qaint

Qaint is a browser-based interactive demo recording platform designed for product teams, developers, sales teams, educators, and designers. It enables users to capture real-time product interactions and convert them into reusable, high-fidelity demo assets.

This repository contains the source code for qaint.in.



## What Qaint Does

Qaint allows you to:

- Record live product interactions directly in the browser  
- Capture mouse movements, clicks, transitions, and UI flows  
- Replay recorded sessions instantly  
- Trim unwanted sections of a recording  
- Export demos for documentation, collaboration, or presentation  
- Manage multiple demo sessions as organized assets  

The platform focuses on clarity, speed, and user control.



## Core Features

### Recording Engine
